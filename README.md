# Markdown Previewer
The Markdown Previewer is a web application that allows you to write and preview Markdown content in real-time. It uses the `marked` library to convert Markdown syntax into HTML for rendering.

The Markdown Previewer is built using the following technologies:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
